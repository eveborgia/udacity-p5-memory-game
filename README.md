# Memory-Game

This is a  browser-based card matching game written in javascript for my Udacity nano degree.

### How to play:

* Click a card to flip it over, you will see its **symbol**.
* Click a second card. This one will flip too. Did you _match_ the symbols? If not, try again.
* If the cards did match, both cards will stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back face down.
* The game **ends** once all cards have been matched.
* A message will pop up once the game is over. 
* If you press _ok_ the message will desapear and you will have to press the spinning arrow to reset the game.
* If you press _reset_ you can start the game again.
* Once you press _reset_, the **star count** resets, the **matched moves** reset and the **countdown**.
* There will be _comments_ on every single function but the ones that the function name is suggestive.
